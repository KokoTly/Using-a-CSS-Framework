            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>CSS frameworks are pre-prepared libraries containing styles and templates that standardize and streamline the design and development process. They enhance the efficiency of styling web pages, allowing developers to expedite their workflow. CSS frameworks tackle the challenge of responsive design, seamlessly adapting layouts to diverse screen sizes.</p>

            <h2>Use Cases</h2>
            <p>Other than time-saving, teams comprising several developers benefit from the standards offered by CSS frameworks. Rather than each developer on a project adding their own style of names, frameworks regulate layouts, easily read othersâ€™ code, and smooth the development cycle with fewer bugs and better team communication.<br> 

                Bootstrap and Foundation are widely and frequently used CSS framework examples.</p>
